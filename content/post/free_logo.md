I recently wrote about **noturno**, a Firefox add-on I wrote to help switching between proxy configurations.

Since a few people have been downloading this add-on, I decided it needed some loving, and went to /r/freedesign on reddit to get it a logo and some buttons.

In a few hours I got a reply from /u/wnhDanny with a nice logo for the add-on:

Here is my post in the subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/freedesign/comments/436pk9/requestlogoforfirefoxaddon/

So, if you do have that Free Software project that needs some designs and you are like me: no artistic talents, you could just check out reddit for ~~a nice free logo~~ some contribution :)
