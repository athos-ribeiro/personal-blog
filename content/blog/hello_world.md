![Hello World](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8048/8384772376_4c18707007.jpg)

I have been willing to write a blog for a while now and finally set this up. Here I will write about technical things related to programming, computer science and free software. I will also post my political view on some matters and eventually post about some of my hobbies which may include music, beer and other stuff.

The posts will be written in Portuguese or English, depending who I want to reach with each of the posts.

That's it for now :)
