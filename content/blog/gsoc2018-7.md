# Triggering Debian Unstable builds on Open Build Service

As I have been reporting on previous posts, whenever one tries to  build
packages against Debian unstable with Debian Stretch OBS packages, the
OBS scheduler would download the package dependencies and clean up the
cacher before the downloads were completed. This would cause builds to
never get triggered: OBS would keep downloading dependencies forever.

This would only happen for builds on debian sid (unstable) and buster
(testing).

After some investigation (as already reported before), we realized that the OBS
version packaged in Debian 9 (the one we are currently using) [does not support
debian source packages built with dpkg >=
1.19](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/issues/395).

While the backports package included the patch needed to support source
packages built with newer versions of dpkg, we would still get the same issue
with unstable and testing builds.

We spent a lot of time stuck in this issue, and I ended up proposing to host
the whole archive in our OBS instance so we could use it as dependencies for
new packages. It ended up being a terrible idea, since it would be unfeasible
to test it locally and we would have to update the packages on each accepted
upload into debian unstable (note that several packages get updated every day).
Hence, I kept studying OBS code to understand how builds get triggered and
why it would not happen for unstable/testing packages.

After diving into OBS code, we realized that it uses
[libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv) to read repositories. In
libsolv's change history, we found that [there was an arbitrary size limit to
the debian control file, which was fixed in an newer version of the
package](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/pull/273).

After updating the `libsolv0`, `libsolv-perl` and `libsolvext0` packages (using
Debian Buster versions), we could **finally trigger Debian unstable builds**.

# Substituting gcc for clang in build time

With OBS being able to trigger builds for Debian Unstable, we now needed to be
able to substitute builds with gcc for builds with the clang compiler. As
suggested by my mentor, Sylvestre, we wanted to substitute gcc binaries for
clang ones. For that, we needed to find a way to [run a script suggest by
Sylvestre](https://salsa.debian.org/lucas/cloud-scripts/blob/master/modes/clang60)
in our build environments prior triggering the builds.

Fortunately, Open Build Service has a [Source Services
feature](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html)
that can do exactly that: change source code before builds or run specific
tasks in the build environment during build time. For the latter (which is what
we needed to substitute gcc binaries), OBS requires one to build an
`obs-service-SERVICE_NAME` package, which will be injected in the build
environment as a dependency and get whatever task specified by that package
performed.

We built our
[obs-service-clang-build](https://irill8.siege.inria.fr/package/show/Debian:Unstable:Clang/obs-service-clang-build)
package with the needed scripts to perform the gcc/clang substitutions in build time.

To activate the substitution task for a package, it should contain a `_service`
file with in its root path (along with the debian and pristine sources) the
following content:

```
<services>
  <service name="clang_build" mode="buildtime" />
</services>
```

If everything is correct, we should see

```
[  TIME in seconds] Running build time source services...
```

in the log file, followed by the gcc substitution commands.

# Automating clang builds for new Debian unstable uploads

Now, we must proceed to trigger Debian unstable builds for newly accepted
uploads. To do so, we wrote a cron job to monitor the
[debian-devel-changes](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes/) mailing
list. We check for new source uploads to debian unstable and trigger a new build
for those new packages (we added a 4 hour cool-down before triggering the build
to allow the package to propagate through the mirrors).

The results can be seen at

# Updating links in Debian distro-tracker

Debian [distro-tracker](https://tracker.debian.org) has links to clang builds,
which would point to the former service at
[clang.debian.net](https://clang.debian.net). We now want to substitute those
links to point to our new OBS instance. Thus, we opened a new [pull
request](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/distro-tracker/merge_requests/47) to perform
such change.

# Next steps

Now that we have an instance of our project up and running, there are a few
tasks left for our final GSoC submission.

* Migrate salt scripts from my personal github namespace to https://github.com/opencollab/llvm-slave-salt. A few adjustments may be needed due to the environment differences.
* Write some documentation for the project and a guide on how to add new workers
* Create a separate github project for the cron which analyzes debian-devel-changes mailing list
* Create a separate github project for the obs-service-clang-build package
