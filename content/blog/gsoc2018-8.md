## Project Overview

Debian package builds with Clang were performed from time to time through
massive rebuilds of the Debian archive on AWS. The results of these builds are
published on [clang.debian.net](http://clang.debian.net/). This summer
project aimed to automate Debian archive clang rebuilds by substituting the
current clang builds in clang.debian.net with Open Build System (OBS) builds.

Our final product consists of a repository with [salt
states](https://saltstack.com) to deploy an OBS instance which triggers Clang
builds of Debian Unstable packages as soon as they get uploaded by their
maintainers.

An instance of our clang builder is hosted at
[irill8.siege.inria.fr](https://irill8.siege.inria.fr) and the Clang builds
triggered so far can be seen
[here](https://irill8.siege.inria.fr/project/show/Debian:Unstable:Clang).

My Google Summer of Code Project can bee seen at
[summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6144149196111872](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6144149196111872).

## My contributions

The major contribution for the summer is our running OBS instance at
[irill8.siege.inria.fr](https://irill8.siege.inria.fr).

### Salt states to deploy our OBS intance

We created a series of Salt states to deploy and configure our OBS instance.
The states for local deploy and development are available at
[github.com/athos-ribeiro/salt-obs](https://github.com/athos-ribeiro/salt-obs).

### OBS Source Service to make gcc/clang binary substitutions

To perform deb packages Clang builds, we substitute GCC binaries with the Clang
binaries in the builders chroot during build time. To do that, we use the OBS
Source Services feature, which requires a package (which performs the desired task) to
be available to the target OBS project.

Our obs-service-clang-build package is hosted at
[github.com/athos-ribeiro/obs-service-clang-build](https://github.com/athos-ribeiro/obs-service-clang-build).

### Monitor Debian Unstable archive and trigger clang builds for newly uploaded packages

We also use two scripts to monitor the debian-devel-changes mailing lists,
watching for new package uploads in Debian Unstable, and trigger Clang builds
in our OBS instance whenever a new upload is accepted.

Our scripts to monitor the debian-devel-changes mailing list and trigger Clang
builds in our OBS instance are available at
[github.com/athos-ribeiro/obs-trigger-sid-builds](https://github.com/athos-ribeiro/obs-trigger-sid-builds).

### OBS documentation contributions

During the summer, most of my work was to read OBS documentation and code to
understand how to trigger Debian Unstable builds in OBS and how to perform
customized Clang builds (replacing GCC).

### Pending PRs

We want to change the Clang build links at
[tracker.debian.org/pkg/firefox](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firefox) To do
so, we must change Debian distro-tracker to point to our OBS instance. As of
the time this post was written, we have an open PR in distro-tracker to change
the URLs:

- https://salsa.debian.org/qa/distro-tracker/merge_requests/47

## Adding new workers to the OBS instance

To configure new workers to our current OBS instance, hosted at irill8.siege.inria.fr, just set new salt slaves and provision them with `obs-common` and `obs-worker`, from [github.com/opencollab/llvm-slave-salt](https://github.com/opencollab/llvm-slave-salt/). This should be done in the `top.sls` file.

## Future work

- We want to extend our OBS instance with more projects to provide Upstream LLVM packages to Debian and derived distributions.
- More automation is needed in our salt states. For instance, we may want to automate SSL certificates generation using Let's encrypt.
- During the summer, several issues were detected in Debian Stable OBS packages. We want to work closer to OBS packages to help improving OBS packages and OBS itself.

## Google Summer of Code experience

Working with Debian during the summer was an interesting experience. I did not
expect to have so many problems as I did (see reports) with the OBS packages.
This problems were turned into hours of debuging and reading Perl code in order
to understand how OBS processes comunicate and trigger new builds. I also
learned more about Debian packaging, salt and vagrant. I do expect to keep
working with OBS and help maintaining the service we deployed during the
summer. There's still a lot of room for improvements and it is easy to see how
the project benefits FLOSS communities.
