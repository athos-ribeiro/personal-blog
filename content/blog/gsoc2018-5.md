# Debian builds on OBS

OBS supports building Debian packages. To do so, one must properly configure a
project so OBS knows it is building a `.deb` package and to have the packages
needed to handle and build debian packages installed.

[openSUSE's OBS instance](https://build.opensuse.org) has repositories for
[Debian 8](https://build.opensuse.org/project/prjconf/Debian:8.0), [Debian
9](https://build.opensuse.org/project/prjconf/Debian:9.0), and [Debian
testing](https://build.opensuse.org/project/prjconf/Debian:Next).

We will use base Debian projects in our OBS instance as **Download on Demand**
projects and use subprojects to achieve our final goal (build packages agains
Clang). By using the same configurations as  the ones in the openSUSE public
projects, we could perform builds in Debian 8 and Debian 9 in our local OBS
deploys. However, builds for Debian Testing and Unstable were failing.

With further investigation, we realized the OBS version packaged in Debian
cannot decompress `control.tar.xz` files in `.deb` packages, which is the
default compression format for the control tarball since `dpkg-1.19` (it used
to be control.tar.gz before that). This issue was reported on [the OBS
repositories](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/issues/395) and was fixed
on a [Pull Request](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/pull/397) that is
not included in the current Debian OBS version yet. For now, we apply this
patch in our OBS instance on our salt states.

After applying the patch, the builds on Debian 8 and 9 are still finishing with
success, but builds against Debian Testing and Unstable are getting stuck in a
`blocked` state: dependencies are being downloaded, the OBS scheduler stalls
for a while, the downloaded packages get cleaned up, and then the dependencies
are downloaded again. OBS backend enters in a loop doing the described
procedure and never assigns a build to a worker. No logs with hints leading to
a possible issue are issued, giving us no clue of the current problem.

Although I am inclined to believe we have a problem with our dependencies list,
I am still debugging this issue  during this week and will bring more news on
my next post.

## Refactoring project configuration files

Reshabh opened a [Pull Request in our salt
repository](https://github.com/opencollab/llvm-slave-salt/pull/8#discussion_r195902552)
with the OBS configuration files for Ubuntu, also based on the openSUSE's OBS
public configurations. Based on Sylvestre comments, I have been refactoring the
Debian configuration files based on the [OBS
docuemtation](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.prjconfig.html).
One of the proposed improvements is to use `debootstrap` to mount the builder
chroot. This will allow us to reduce the number of dependencies listed in the
projects configuration files.  The issue which generated debootstrap support in
OBS is available at https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/issues/111 and may lead
to more interesting resources on the matter.

# Next steps (A TODO list to keep on the radar)

- Fix OBS builds on Debian Testing and Unstable
- Write patches for the OBS worker issue described in [post 3]({{< ref "gsoc2018-3.md" >}})
- Change the default builder to perform builds with clang
- Trigger new builds by using the dak/mailing lists messages
- Verify the rake-tasks.sh script idempotency and propose patch to opencollab repository
- Separate salt recipes for workers and server (locally)
- Properly set hostnames (locally)
