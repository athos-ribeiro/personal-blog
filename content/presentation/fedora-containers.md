The OpenShift Build Service (OSBS) is a collection of tools, workflows and
integration points that build and release layered container images.

OSBS is used with Fedora's build system (koji) to build the layered images
shipped in registry.fedoraproject.org.

In this session, I gave an an overview of what happens behind the curtains when
a container image build is triggered in the Fedora infrastructure and what one
needs to do to include an image in registry.fedoraproject.org.
